I decided to tweak this idea a little : the principle would be the same, but there would be many balls, and they would move because of the repulsion force created by a magnet controlled by the player.\nUnity installation and setup The first step was to install Unity 3D. Unity provides a tool called Unity Hub, which is useful to manage multiple projects using different versions of Unity 3D. Then I chose to create a new 3D project using Unity 2020.3.21f1. It is an LTS version, which means that it will be maintained for an extended amount of time.\nSo I arrived at the Unity editor, with a new scene, containing only a Skybox, a Camera, and a Directional Light. In the Project Window, I created various folders to contain the assets I would use later on : one for the two scenes (PC and VR version), one for the materials, one for the scripts, etc.\nVersioning As soon as this setup was made, I created a GitHub repository to version the various project files. From now, every new feature induced a commit and a push on the remote repository.\nI was careful to add a .gitignore file to avoid pushing on the remote repository heavy files, like builds, visual assets and external libraries.\n3D Magnet Game Main elements The main elements of this game are a board, a number of metallic balls, and one magnet. I used very simple GameObjects to represent these elements : respectively a plane, spheres, and a capsule.\nI then made a prefab for each of these elements, and attached a corresponding script tho the Sphere and the Magnet Prefab. These scripts would contain the implementation of the magnetic interaction system.\nPhysics The main principle behind the magnetic interaction system is the following.\n  The Magnet has a Collider Component, much larger than its actual mesh. This collider represents the boundaries of the magnetic field.   Each sphere has a Rigidbody, which allows it to register collisions with the magnet’s collider. A sphere starts keeping track of the MagnetInfo of the Magnet when it enters its collider for the first time.\n  class MagnetInfo { public GameObject magnetObject; public float strength; public bool isActive; }  At each frame (I used the FixedUpdate method, as physics are involved), a sphere gets applied a force depending on its distance to the magnet, as well as the magnet strength. I chose to limit the movement of the spheres to 2 dimensions, so their Y position is frozen.  if (magnet.isActive) { isAffected = true; float xMagnet = magnet.magnetObject.transform.position.x; float zMagnet = magnet.magnetObject.transform.position.z; float x = transform.position.x; float z = transform.position.z; float norm = (Mathf.Sqrt(Mathf.Pow(xMagnet - x, 2) + Mathf.Pow(zMagnet - z, 2))); float distanceFactor = 1 / norm; m_rigidbody.AddForce(Mathf.Pow(distanceFactor, 2) * magnet.strength * new Vector3(xMagnet - x, 0, zMagnet - z).normalized); } The function used to calculate the force applied is not exactly the right one, but it respects the basic physics of magnetic fields : its norm is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the sphere and the magnet.\nInputs I then provided a simple way for the player to move the magnet in the environment using arrow keys. For this version, the magnet can only move in a horizontal plane, at a fixed height.\nprivate void Update() { Vector3 currentPosition = Vector3.zero; if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.UpArrow)) { currentPosition.z += Time.deltaTime * speed; } if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.DownArrow)) { currentPosition.z -= Time.deltaTime * speed; } if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftArrow)) { currentPosition.x -= Time.deltaTime * speed; } if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.RightArrow)) { currentPosition.x += Time.deltaTime * speed; } this.transform.position += currentPosition; } Environment and assets I then added several GameObjects to close the board on the side. I also created a metallic texture for the spheres, and used an asset from the Unity Asset Store to make the board look more natural.\nPorting the game to VR The last step was to port the game to Virtual Reality, so that it could be deployed on an Oculus Quest 2.\nThe physics system did not need any modification. However, I needed to setup the Oculus Package so that I could use the camera from the device, as well as the input for its controllers. This tutorial guided me through this process.\nIn terms of input, I just chose to let the user physically move the magnet, without using any buttons. So I made the Magnet GameObject a children of the RightHandController from the Oculus Package.\nDeveloping for VR also implies making changes in the Build and Player Settings from the Unity Project. For instance, I had to disable the Vulkan rendering API and switch the Color Space to linear. I also switched the plaform of the project to Android.\nFinally, I adapted the size of the scene so that the board and spheres looked natural to the player, and I had a simple, playable game in VR.\n","wordCount":"854","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://thanaell.github.io/images/magnet_game.PNG","datePublished":"2022-02-02T12:27:17+01:00","dateModified":"2022-02-02T12:27:17+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://thanaell.github.io/posts/igd301/unity-setup/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Gaëlle Clavelin","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://thanaell.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
