The idea was to simulate physiological harm to induce negative feelings (fear, discomfort) for a user, in order to make them pull their hand away from an area. During the process, I used a haptic device to increase the realism of my prototype. I realized that if the device was effective in creating more negative feelings, it meant that there was a potential of harm in building more and more realistic haptics devices. This hypothesis will be tested in the next few months through a study.\nInitial idea : implementing an example of Persuasive Design The initial idea for this project was to implement an example of Persuasive Design. Persuasive design is a practive whose purpose is to influence (nudge) a user’s behavior towards a certain action. In VR, this action implies a embodied movement from the user (either from a body part, or from their whole body) in space. As the user is wearing a VR headset, and is disconnected from reality, this has the potential to be harmmful : for instance, one could make the user fall, or collide with the environment.\nSome ways to nudge the user involve “pulling” them, by attracting them to an area, even if they know they should not go there. For instance, making them move further and further away from their safe environment by making them follow falling objects.\nAnother one involves “pushing” the user, by inducing feelings that make them want to move away from a particular area. In this project, I tried to design an experiment that would create a “pushing” nudge. I went with the simple idea of making a user want to move their hand away from an area. By simulating the infliction of harm on their index finger, I hoped it would generate discomfort, and make them want to pull their hand back.\nThis decision came from several factors :\n easiness of implementation : several industrial devices provide support for finger tracking, hand models, etc. the finger is one of the most sensitive parts of the humann body, so it’s easy to feel discomfort, or even pain on this area.  I decided to go with a simple scenario : the virtual finger of the user is lifted up, slowly bends, and then suddenly dislocates backwards.\nPrototype To make this scenario testable on actual users, I developed a first VR prototype using Unity 3D.\nVisual only The first iteration of the prototype only involved visuals. I used an Oculus Quest 2, as it provides native finger-tracking. By using the LateUpdate() method, I overrode the animation on the finger model of the Quest to add a bending effect to the representation of the user’s finger.\nAdding haptics This first iteration was visually quite convincing. It actually looked like a finger was dislocating, and the users did feel some discomfort at looking at it. However, they did not feel like it was their finger dislocating. As soon as the virtual finger started moving, they lost the feeling of ownership over it, and so felt quite disconnected from what happened.\nTo solve this problem, I added a haptic device in order to increase the feeling of body ownership over the virtual finger. The virtual finger and the real one would both bend at the same time. Only the dislocation would happen virtually but not in the real world.\nThe haptic device prototype consists of a wooden box (laser-cut). On top of the box, a small plank, controlled by a servomotor, can lift. The servomotor is itself controlled by an Arduino UNO, situated inside the box.\nSynchronization To make the experience believable, I had to synchronize the haptic and the virtual experiences, both in time and in space.\nTime synchronization I used a Unity package called Uduino to asset store Unity to make the bending happen at exactly the same speed in the real world and in the Unity scene. Uduino creates a new GameObject in Unity. By manipulating this Game Object, either in the inspector or directly through C# code, it is possible to to send inputs directly to the Arduino UNO, either from the Unity inspector.\nSpatial synchronization I also had to make sure that both “scenes” (the real world experiment and the virtual scene) are spatially aligned, so the user doesn’t feel an offset between them, because this could reduce the feeling of embodiment in VR. I created two Game Objects, which I called “virtual controllers”. By adjusting the Unity scene (scaline, rotating and translating) so that the virtual controllers are in the same spot as the real ones, I managed to align the scene to the real world environment. Once this process is done, I can remove the real controllers and switch to finger tracking to start the experiment.\nFinal idea : testing the harmful potential of haptic realism While I was building the haptic prototype, I realized that my project raised some ethical issues about the use of highly realistic haptic devices in HCI. Indeed, here I uses haptics to increase realism, and thus body ownership, in order to generate more negative feelings for a user. At some point, I imagined that it might be possible to induce fear, discomfort, or even some form of pain to a user, even though no physiological harm is inflicted.\nMy prototype is not this realistic, and only has a small effect on the user. But haptic devices are getting more and more sophisticated and realistic, especially on the hands (haptic gloves, etc). These devices might have the potential to induce a plethora of negative feelings, and maybe even trauma, to the user.\nFrom this idea, I decided to change the approach I took on this project, and to test this hypothesis.\nPerspectives In the upcoming months, I will run a study to test how the realism impacts the negative feelings of the user. So first, I will need to improve the realism of the experiment as much as possible, given the existin prototype.\nImproving realism Solenoid The first step will be to add a simulation of an impact at the moment of the dislocation. I will use a solenoid to generate this impact at the base of the user’s finger.\nVisualization Right now, the combination of visuals and haptics suffers from a slight problem : there is an angle limitation on the Oculus Quest finger tracking, as it was not meant to handle “unnatural” angles. So when the real finger bends beyond 30° or so, the finger tracking stops working properly, and the virtual finger does not follow the expected movement.\nI’m thinking of several options to improve this :\n change the finger tracking method. I’ve thought about using a Leap Motion, but I might be faced with the exact same angle limitation. “Manually” override the virtual’s finger position to control the visual bending (it should be transparent for the user, as their real finger should not move during the experiment.)  Running a study Ethics Before running this study, I will have to present my protocol to an ethics committee. Indeed, I am hoping to show that my device can induce negative feelings, and even pain or trauma to the participants. If this happens, the result would be very important; but the study has to be run with care to protect the participants from harm.\nModalities The study will consist in the comparison of three modalities :\nVisual only: The participant will wear a VR HMD. They will also put their hand on the box, but nothing will happen physically. They will just see the virtual bending and dislocation.\nHaptic-only:The participant will put their hand on the box, but will not wear a VR HMD. The haptic prototype will then bend to the maximum angle, and the solenoid will create an impact at the base of their finger.\nCombined : The participant will put their hand on the box and wear a VR HMD. Then, synchronously, the virtual and real finger will bend. At the maximum angle, the virtual finger will dislocate, and the solenoid will create an impact on the real finger.\nDuring the experiment, I will measure biometric data of the participants that can be representative of the physiological feelings we might induce: heart rate and pupillometry, for instance. After the experiment, the presence and embodiment of participants will be evaluated through questionnaires, as well as the level of discomfort and pain they felt, their level of fear and their global emotional state.\nExpected results During this study, we propose to examine the following hypotheses: H1: Presence and embodiment are higher whenever haptics are used. Indeed, this is a result that has already been observed, and the reason why haptic devices tend to be used to enhance VR experiences. H2: The discomfort/pain level felt by the participant is stronger when using haptics, compared to VR visualization alone. H3: The discomfort/pain level felt by the participant is stronger when using a combination of VR visualization and haptics, compared to haptics alone and VR visualization alone.\nIn the Haptic Only and Combined conditions, if a participant answers that they felt pain, it will mean that it is possible to induce pain (and thus potential trauma) to users of haptic devices, even though these devices are carefully calibrated not to inflict any physiological harm.\n","wordCount":"1557","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://thanaell.github.io/images/box_lifted.jpg","datePublished":"2022-03-03T12:27:17+01:00","dateModified":"2022-03-03T12:27:17+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://thanaell.github.io/posts/hciresearch/guided_project/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Gaëlle Clavelin","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://thanaell.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
